# Scratch Assembly
Scratch Assembly (SASM) is a low-level language that can directly compile to Scratch Blocks. To enable SASM to be read and edited by humans, there is a textual representation of the SASM binary format called Scratch Assembly Text Format. Editing binary is not supported and may cause unexcepted errors.
